## Using Astro over React/Next to build this blog.

Before I decided to build this blog with Astro, I have never used or knew how Astro was.

The only thing that make me choose Astro over other options were the recommendation from some people that I follow on YouTube and twitter.

Before this, i hade made a different version of this blog with _**React and Sanity**_, and the experience was not good, not because of the technologies used, it was more about the purpose of the website.

Because this is a blog, having to wait for the data to load didn't seam to me as a very good idea.

## Learning curve of Astro

Astro was actually really ease to learn, not like I'm an expert now or something, but just in few days doing the tutorial on Astro's website I already had a good understanding on how it works.

Now I'm still learning it to improve this blog even more.

Thank you.
